# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository includes all the code for this project. With the code provided, I have been able to build upon it to practice and define my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. 

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
5. (Possibler optional shortcut) if you know how, npm start should also work after all dependencies are installed to your terminal!

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- body-parser
- express

## Screenshots

Below I will provide screenshots of the app's general UI.
